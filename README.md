# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics. Using Python and common ML libraries, we trained, tested, and evaluated models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Overview
The Diabetes Prediction Project is a machine learning application that analyzes patient data to predict diabetes presence. The goal is to support early diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals in preventive measures.

**Project Structure:**
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks, including the primary notebook (`File.ipynb`) used for developing and experimenting with models.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project.
  
## Dataset
The project uses a structured dataset containing patient records with features such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, and more. Each entry is labeled to indicate whether the individual has diabetes.

**Data Source:** [Add data source if public, otherwise mention "Confidential"]

**Sample Data Fields:**
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 or 1 indicating absence or presence of diabetes)

## Features
The model leverages a mix of personal and health-related features:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Family history impact score
- **Age**: Age in years

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `File.ipynb` and follow the steps to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train models and evaluate results.
   - Save the trained model for deployment.

## Modeling and Evaluation
In this project, we explored multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

## Results
[Include results such as the best model performance metrics and any significant findings]

### Key Findings
- Model X achieved the highest accuracy of XX% on the test set.
- Feature Y was the most influential in predicting diabetes presence.
